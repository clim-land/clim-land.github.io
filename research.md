# Research

Our research group focuses on developing integrated solutions for environmental sustainability and climate resilience. Moreover，our research direction is multidisciplinary, integrating the fields of environmental science, ecology, economics, and physics to address some of the most pressing challenges posed by climate change and land use dynamics.

One of our research is to develop comprehensive models and strategies to mitigate large-scale soil erosion, a crucial issue that significantly impacts land use and land cover change. We aim to understand the dynamics of soil erosion processes and their implications on agricultural productivity, water resources, and ecosystem health.

Another critical aspect of our research focuses on forest carbon sinks. We investigate how forests can be managed and conserved to optimize their role in sequestering carbon dioxide, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. This involves studying forest dynamics, species composition, and the impacts of human activities on forest health.

In the realm of climate economics, our group analyzes the economic impacts of climate change and the cost-effectiveness of various mitigation and adaptation strategies. We aim to provide insights into how economic policies can be aligned with environmental sustainability to foster a low-carbon economy.

Additionally, the principles of thermodynamics are applied in our research to understand energy exchanges in natural systems and their relation to climate processes. This includes studying the energy balance of ecosystems and the thermodynamic aspects of atmospheric processes.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Our objective is to synergize the acclimate model to elucidate the dynamics of how sudden events impact the economic system, specifically focusing on how production losses ripple through the supply chain network.** We endeavor to uncover the intricate cascading effects that manifest across the supply chains of diverse countries, regions, and sectors. Our analysis aims to evaluate the potential impacts of a range of climate policies, adaptation approaches, and mitigation strategies. Through this, we aspire to determine how various adaptive measures can bolster the resilience of the economic system. This comprehensive analysis will serve as a foundational scientific guide, aiding professionals in making informed decisions for disaster prevention, strategic deployment, and the optimized allocation of resources during the critical phase of post-disaster reconstruction
