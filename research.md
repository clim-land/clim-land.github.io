# Research

**Our research group focuses on developing integrated solutions for environmental sustainability and climate resilience. Moreover，our research direction is multidisciplinary, integrating the fields of environmental science, ecology, economics, and physics to address some of the most pressing challenges posed by climate change and land use dynamics.**

One of our research is to develop comprehensive models and strategies to mitigate large-scale soil erosion, a crucial issue that significantly impacts land use and land cover change. We aim to understand the dynamics of soil erosion processes and their implications on agricultural productivity, water resources, and ecosystem health.

Another critical aspect of our research focuses on forest carbon sinks. We investigate how forests can be managed and conserved to optimize their role in sequestering carbon dioxide, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. This involves studying forest dynamics, species composition, and the impacts of human activities on forest health.

In the realm of climate economics, our group analyzes the economic impacts of climate change and the cost-effectiveness of various mitigation and adaptation strategies. We aim to provide insights into how economic policies can be aligned with environmental sustainability to foster a low-carbon economy.

Additionally, the principles of thermodynamics are applied in our research to understand energy exchanges in natural systems and their relation to climate processes. This includes studying the energy balance of ecosystems and the thermodynamic aspects of atmospheric processes.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

### <i>Climate economics

**Our objective is to synergize the acclimate model to elucidate the dynamics of how sudden events impact the economic system, specifically focusing on how production losses ripple through the supply chain network.** We endeavor to uncover the intricate cascading effects that manifest across the supply chains of diverse countries, regions, and sectors. Our analysis aims to evaluate the potential impacts of a range of climate policies, adaptation approaches, and mitigation strategies. Through this, we aspire to determine how various adaptive measures can bolster the resilience of the economic system. This comprehensive analysis will serve as a foundational scientific guide, aiding professionals in making informed decisions for disaster prevention, strategic deployment, and the optimized allocation of resources during the critical phase of post-disaster reconstruction

### <i>Land use/land cover

Using the global land use quantities for 235 basins predicted by the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) as demand data, we employs the Cellular Automaton Model (CA Model) suitable for global-scale land use modeling and coupled with human activities and natural environmental changes in each basin. It iteratively simulates the changes in various land class patches driven by future development probabilities over different periods, thereby generating a high-resolution LULC dataset over a long time series under different SSP-RCP scenarios. 

**Based on this, we plan to use a spatial crop distribution model to further differentiate the distribution of different crops, and to downscale global urban land use using different industrial population as proxy indicators, thus obtaining a LULC dataset with finer land use/cover types and higher spatial resolution.**
#### <i>Crop
Integrating remote sensing and statistical data, we utilize the crop spatial distribution model based on cross information entropy and machine learning algorithms to identify the gridded distribution information of crop-explicit harvested areas at global and national scales.
#### <i>Soil erosion
Relying on big data from remote sensing and the long-term, high-precision LULC and crop harvested area datasets produced by our lab, we estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of high-precision soil erosion patterns at global/national/sub-national scales during historical periods and under different future climate scenarios based on empirical soil erosion models. Furthermore, we map the soil erosion footprint at various spatial scales by integrating MRIOA.
