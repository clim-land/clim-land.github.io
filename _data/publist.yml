- title: "Evaluating temporal-spatial variations of wetland ecosystem service value in China during 1990–2020 from the donor side based on cosmic exergy"
  image: evaluating.jpg
  description: The main objective of this paper is to construct a cosmic-exergy-based accounting framework for wetland ecosystem service valuation and comprehensively evaluate the spatiotemporal characteristics of wetland ecosystem service value in China during 1990–2020 from a donor-side perspective. According to the results, the ecological equality of wetland ecosystems in different regions is demonstrated, and suggestions for protecting and utilizing wetland natural resources are put forward.
