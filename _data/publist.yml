- title: "Crop-Specific Emission Projection Suggests Peaking of Agricultural N2O by the Middle Century"
  image: tian.png
  description: This study uses an integrated assessment model with a land cover downscaling module to project crop-specific N2O emissions at 0.05° resolution under various SSP-RCP scenarios from 2025 to 2100. Results show a global N2O emission peak around 2065, ranging from 5.2 to 6.6 Tg N a–1. Corn cultivation is the main contributor, while rice emits less and peaks before 2025.

- title: "The effect of day-to-day temperature variability on agricultural productivity"
  image: zou.jpg
  description: This study examines how day-to-day temperature variability and shifts in rainfall patterns impacted global agricultural productivity from 1961 to 2018. Results show that day-to-day temperature variability both negatively affects total factor productivity (TFP) and shapes the influence of monthly average temperatures and wet days.
